description: Setup and bootstrap entry point for WebSculpt. Use when you need to acquire or verify external information, scrape web pages, call APIs, perform browser automation, or use the WebSculpt command library, and the websculpt command is unavailable (not installed or broken) in the current environment — you must complete setup through this skill before acquiring information. Also use when the user explicitly asks to install, update, or repair WebSculpt. If other WebSculpt lifecycle skills such as websculpt-explore are already present in your available skill list, the environment is ready — do not load this skill; use the corresponding lifecycle skill directly.

# WebSculpt Bootstrap

## When to Use WebSculpt

WebSculpt is good at two things: getting information from behind login walls and content walls, and turning high-frequency, repetitive web operations into CLI commands that you can later invoke in one sentence without re-spending model context. Typical scenarios:

- **Content creators / self-media bloggers**: download video clips from Douyin, Xiaohongshu, or Bilibili; analyze benchmark accounts' posting cadence and viral content; harvest comment-section feedback for topic ideas.
- **E-commerce operators**: regularly monitor competitor stores' pricing, new listings, and sales changes; track competitor ad creatives.
- **Investment research / finance professionals**: regularly pull research reports, filings, and high-frequency tracking data; quant teams can also harvest alternative data such as sentiment and community buzz.
- **Consultants / industry researchers**: track industry developments — much first-hand information sits inside content platforms like Xiaohongshu and Zhihu.
- **AI practitioners / researchers**: track AI products and competitor moves, follow frontier technology progress, and monitor community discussion heat.

These are only examples. Any scenario where "the information is behind a wall" or "the operation repeats frequently" is a good fit for WebSculpt.

## The Four Lifecycle Skills

A command's full lifecycle is: discover through exploration → solidify into a command → repair when broken → organize and migrate. Each stage is owned by one skill:

- **websculpt-explore**: when the command library has no ready-made command for what you need, use it to explore and validate an acquisition path. Most tasks start here. For example:

  ```
  /websculpt-explore Use my browser to download the video at https://www.douyin.com/video/1234567890
  /websculpt-explore Research Perplexity's feature updates over the past six months and organize them into a timeline
  /websculpt-explore Use my logged-in account to export this month's creator-center data report from Xiaohongshu
  ```

- **websculpt-capture**: once explore has proven a path end-to-end and you want to solidify it into a reusable command, use this. It is usually suggested by explore after validation passes; no manual triggering needed.

- **websculpt-maintain**: when an installed command breaks, errors out, or needs new parameters or output changes, use it to repair. For example:

  ```
  /websculpt-maintain The YouTube video download command stopped working — please fix it
  /websculpt-maintain The competitor price monitoring command has been returning empty data for days — take a look
  /websculpt-maintain Add a parameter to the Weibo hot-search monitoring command so it only shows the top 10
  ```

- **websculpt-library**: when there are too many commands and you want to narrow the display, or you need to back up, migrate, or share the command library. For example:

  ```
  /websculpt-library Export the download commands for the various video platforms — I want to send them to a friend
  /websculpt-library There are too many commands — only show the e-commerce monitoring ones in this project
  /websculpt-library I switched to a new computer — import the command library I backed up
  ```

## Role

This skill is the WebSculpt bootstrapper, not an information-gathering tool. It plays three time-phased roles:

1. **Installer** (first trigger): check the environment, install the WebSculpt CLI and the four lifecycle skills (explore / capture / maintain / library).
2. **Stand-in router** (remainder of the installing session): newly installed skills are not yet in the host's skill listing. You must read the corresponding installed skill file and follow its protocol to continue the user's task.
3. **Dormant recovery entry** (all later sessions): this skill should not trigger anymore — the lifecycle skills are in place. It wakes only when WebSculpt is broken (e.g. `websculpt: command not found`) or the user explicitly asks to install / update / repair it.

## Step 1: Probe

Always probe before acting; never install blindly:

```bash
websculpt --version
```

- Command not found → proceed to "Install".
- Command works → run `websculpt skill status`. This command has no exit-code semantics — judge by its output text: each skill line reports `installed local`, `installed global`, or `not installed`.
  - All four lifecycle skills report `installed local` or `installed global`, and the user has no install / update / repair intent → go straight to "Route"; do not reinstall.
  - Any skill reports `not installed` → run `npm install -g @playwright/cli@0.1.13` and step 3 of "Install" (install the lifecycle skills), then go to "Route".
- The user explicitly asks to update / repair → go to "Update and Repair".

## Install

### 1. Check Node.js

```bash
node --version
```

Node.js >= 22 is required. If not met, tell the user to install Node.js 22 or later and stop.

### 2. Install the CLI and the browser tool

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@0.1.13 websculpt
```

`@playwright/cli` is the browser-automation dependency used during explore; install it together with the CLI.

If the global install fails due to permissions (e.g. EACCES), do not use sudo — sudo does not exist on Windows, and a sudo install leaves root-owned files in the npm global directory, breaking every later npm operation with permission errors. Use the npx fallback instead: prefix every subsequent `websculpt` command with `npx -y websculpt@latest` and every `playwright-cli` command with `npx -y @playwright/cli@0.1.13` (including skill install and status below).

### 3. Install the lifecycle skills

```bash
websculpt skill install --global
```

This command is idempotent; existing skills are skipped. A global install writes to `.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, and `.agents/skills/` under the user's home directory — the host agent only needs to read one of them.

`--global` is the default here. If the user explicitly wants WebSculpt only inside one project, run `websculpt skill install` (without `--global`) in that project's root instead, which requires an existing `.claude/`, `.codex/`, or `.agents/` directory there.

### 4. Verify and report

```bash
websculpt skill status
```

Confirm all four lifecycle skills report `installed local` or `installed global`. Briefly report to the user: the CLI version, the skill install locations (scope and directories), and that future sessions will trigger these skills automatically.

## Route

Once installation is done (or the probe found everything ready), continue the user's original task:

1. Identify the task's stage: acquiring external information → `websculpt-explore`; solidifying a validated path into a command → `websculpt-capture`; fixing or iterating a broken command → `websculpt-maintain`; organizing / migrating the command library → `websculpt-library`. Most tasks start with explore.
2. Read the corresponding installed skill file and strictly follow its protocol. Locate it by the scope reported by `skill status`: `installed global` means `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` under the user's home directory (identical copies exist under `.claude/skills/` and `.codex/skills/`); `installed local` means the same path under the current project directory.
3. Within this session, whenever any websculpt skill's protocol calls for loading another websculpt skill (e.g. explore suggesting capture), likewise read that skill's installed SKILL.md file instead of relying on host triggering.
4. Do not ask the user to restart the session or restate the task; take over yourself.

## Update and Repair

- Update: `npm update -g websculpt`, then `websculpt skill install --global --force` to refresh the skills so they stay in sync with the new CLI version.
- Repair: if the `websculpt` command is missing or broken, re-run the "Install" flow.
- If `skill install` / `skill status` fails with an unknown command or option, the CLI is outdated: run `npm update -g websculpt` first and retry.
- A broken individual command (a `domain/action`) is not this skill's responsibility; route it to websculpt-maintain.

## Prohibited

- Do not run any install command before probing (`websculpt --version` / `websculpt skill status`).
- Do not reinstall when the CLI and skills are already healthy, and do not ask the user to restart the session; route and continue the task directly.
- Do not use sudo to work around npm global install permission errors; use the npx fallback instead.
- Do not hand-edit the four installed lifecycle skill files; they are refreshed exclusively via `websculpt skill install --force`.
